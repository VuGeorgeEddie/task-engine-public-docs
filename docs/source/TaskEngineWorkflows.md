## Vodstream

This workflow will create a server side manifest, with and/or without DRM, that can be used for on the fly delivery of VOD content via USP.

| content_id        |Yes| Unique identifier of the content. This is usually a key that allows identification of the content in the client’s system.|
| source_folder     |Yes| Location of the source files. All files to be processed will need to be in a discrete folder, the ‘root’ folder will be specified in the client configuration.|

## Additional Workflow Features: 

### Priority

The task engine supports ordering of jobs by priority. The priority parameter can be submitted as part of the json payload being submitted. The priority is in ascending order as follows:

1 - Top Priority  
.  
.  
5 - Default  
.  
.  
10 - Least Priority

The `"priority"` parameter needs to be submitted within the `"job"` section of the json payload as shown below:

```json
{
  "client": "demo-client",
  "job": {
    "workflow": "vodcapture",
    "priority": 3
  },
  "parameters": {
    "content_id": "demo1",
    ...
    ...
    ...
  }
}
```

Whenever an execution slot is available, the system will first check by priority and then check the submission time and date of the job. In the case where multiple jobs are executed with the same priority (eg. with the default priority 5), the Task Engine operates in a FIFO (First In First Out) manner.

## Workflow Trigger Example

Example of a curl command to trigger ingest for the vodstream workflow:

    curl -X POST \
    http://vualto.demo.com/job \
    -H "API-KEY: aabbccdd-1122-3344-5566-eeff77889900" \
    -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "client": "vualto",
      "job": {
        "workflow": "vodstream"
      },
      "parameters": {
          "content_id": "demo_1",
          "source_folder": "/input/demo1",
          "delete_source": false,
          "encrypted": false,
          "output_folder": "/test",
          "drm": [
            "fairplay",
            "playready",
            "cenc",
            "widevine"
          ],"rest_endpoints": [
            "https://webhook.site/55151d14-cee1-416b-b956-a90525ae8f58",
            "https://webhook.site/bc4c13ee-f118-4d5b-a4af-7ac07890a7f1"
          ],
          "create_thumbnail": false,
          "generate_mp4": true,
          "combine_sources": true,
          "create_dref": true,
          "all_audio_tracks": false,
        }
      }

This results in the files `<content_id>_<drm_tag>_<unique_guid>.ism` and `<content_id>_<unique_guid>.ismv` being produced in the folder:

```<configured_root>(/<optional_output_folder>)/<content_id>```

The response from this call should be either a 200 OK, with the following payload:

``` { "job_id": <job_id>, "result": "accepted" } ```

or a 400 BAD REQUEST with the following payload:

``` { "error": "<description_of_error>" } ```

Assuming the call is successful, this would add an ingest job to the Task Engine queue, with the files to be ingested expected to be in the following location:

``` <input_root>/input/demo1 ```

If the process completes successfully, then the output would be the following files:

``` <output_root>/test/demo1.ism ```
``` <output_root>/test/demo1.ismv ```

If the ‘output_folder’ parameter was excluded, then the files would be output to the following locations:

``` <output_root>/demo1.ism ```
``` <output_root>/demo1.ismv ```

**NOTE:** there may be some additional files, depending on the exact processes involved, but the minimum would usually be these.
